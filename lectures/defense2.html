### Typical approach to inference

<p align="center">
  ![:scale 60%](images/defense/typical.png)
</p>
- goal: establish relationship between exposure of interest and data samples, conditional on other covariates
    - conclusion is externally valid: our analysis "generalizes"
- domain expertise: context for unmeasured variables

---

### Measurements are usually manipulated prior to analysis

<p align="center">
  ![:scale 100%](images/defense/typical2.png)
</p>
- the measurement that we obtain is rarely the measurement of interest
  - .ye[derivative]: information that is a function of a raw measurement that is used to learn about the data

---

#### Similar measurements can be collected using many different techniques

![:scale 100%](images/defense/typical3.png)

- small differences in acquisition protocols (device used, settings, technician preparation, etc.) can impart biases to measurements

---

### Reality of inference

![:scale 100%](images/defense/reality.png)

- .ye[Accidental deviations]: sources of variability not of scientific interest
- .ye[Systematic deviations]: variability of interest
- fundamental question of data science: identify systematic deviations in the presence of accidental deviations

---

### What is Reproducibility?

- .ye[Reproducibility]: ability to replicate, or reproduce, a conclusion
- serves as a "first-pass" check for scientific utility
- currently in a "reproducibility crisis"

---

### How do we address the Reproducibility Crisis?

- fix post hoc analyses (e.g., $p$-values)?
- fix measurements (e.g., measurement reproducibility)?

Proposal: design experiments to maximize .ye[inter-item discriminability], rather than simply checking reproducibility after conducting the experiment

![:scale 100%](images/defense/choices.png)


---
### Contributions (Discriminability)

1. Discriminability quantifies the contributions of systematic and accidental deviations
2. Provide theoretical motivation for discriminability in connection with predictive accuracy for .ye[arbitrary tasks]
3. Formalize tests for assessing and comparing discriminabilities within and between collection strategies
4. Illustrate the value of optimizing discriminability for neuroscience and genomics data when downstream inference task .ye[unknown]
5. Code implementations in [python](https://github.com/neurodata/hyppo) and [R](https://github.com/neurodata/r-mgc)
6. Applications paper [1] and theory paper [2]

### Typical problem in causal inference

<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal1.png)</center>

- goal: estimate impact of an exposure (smoking) on measurements (cancer), given a set of covariates (ages)

---


### Problem 1: Unmeasured variables

<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal2.png)</center>

- what if we didn't measure genetics, but genetics cause cancer and influence smoking? [3]

---

### Solution 1


<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal3.png)</center>

- Assume unmeasured variables are minimally impactful

---

### Problem 2


<center>![:scale 60%](images/causal/causal_ex.png)</center>

- Measured: old smokers, and young non-smokers
  - did the smoking cause the cancer, or is cancer just a function of aging?
  - Technical term: .ye[Confounding]

---

### Connectome data

- connectome: brain graph, where the edges indicates the level of functional similarity or structural connectivity between areas of the brain
<p align="center">
  ![:scale 50%](images/defense/fmri_conn.png)
</p>
  - very high-dimensional
  - properties about graph $\Rightarrow$ insights about brain function
- expense $\Rightarrow$ collect data and pool (mega studies)

---

### The problem of batch effects

- .ye[batch effect]: the impact of the data collection procedure (measurement device, measurement protocol, season, etc.) on the data collected [4]
- .ye[demographic effect]: impact on the data of scientifically "interesting" characteristics of the object under study
- When datasets are demographically diverse (high confounding) and measurements are large (high number of features), difficult to <tagname style="color:red">mitigate batch effects</tagname> while <tagname style="color:green;">preserving demographic effects</tagname>

---

### DAG for a neuroimaging study

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/CoRR_DAG.png)</center>

---

### Existing work (detection)

- classical causal inference focuses on this problem for univariate measurements (e.g., smoking)
- some work (conditional independence testing) attempts to do this in multivariate regimes
  - unclear the extent to which these provide reasonable answers in the face of confounding for high-dimensional data

---

### Existing work (correction)

- ComBat [4]
  - fit a linear model, where individual "batches" are a linear transformation of one another
  - optional: "adjust" with terms for covariates (e.g., age, sex)

--
- Surrogate Variable Analysis [5,6]
  - use latent variable models to capture sources of batch heterogeneity

--
- NeuroHarmonize [7]
  - estimate covariate relationships with Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)

---


### How do we propose to address batch effects?

- skip to latent variable modelling (e.g., SVA)?
- focus on estimation with linear/non-linear models (e.g., ComBat, NeuroHarmonize)?
- "It is impossible to publish a paper with multiple datasets in neuroimaging without using ComBat in 2023"

Proposal: leverage techniques from .ye[causal inference] to yield strategies which are both theoretically and empirically sensible for batch effect analyses [8,9]
- develop suitable language and estimands which allow us to be .ye[precise] when referring to batch effects

---

### Motivating questions

- how do we detect causal effects in arbitrary metric spaces?
- how do we formulate batch effects as a problem in causal inference?
- under what assumptions are existing techniques to estimate batch effects reasonable?
- how robust are these techniques to measured confounding?
- .ye[Do we properly understand the limitations of this technique that is used across neuroimaging?]

### Causal discrepancy

Let $ F\_{Y\_i\(t\)| x, z}$ denote the potential outcome distribution, conditional on the measured .ye[and] unmeasured covariates
  - distribution we would expect in exposure $t$ for an individual $i$ with covariates $(x, z)$
$$\forall t \in [K]:\;\;\;\;f\_{Y\_i(t)}(y) = \int\_{\mathcal X, \mathcal Z} f\_{Y\_i\(t\)| x, z}(y) f(x,z) d(x,z)$$

for two exposures $k$ and $l$, there is a .ye[causal discrepancy] if:

$$F\_{Y\_i(k)} \neq F\_{Y\_i(l)}$$

--
- idea: potential outcomes (e.g., connectomes) for an individual differ in exposures (e.g., batches) $k$ and $l$
- "batch effect"

---

### Observational studies and causality

- .ye[observational study]: exposure is not controlled directly by the experimenters
  - $Y_i$ and $Y_i(t)$ do not, in general, have similar conditional/unconditional distributions

--
- problem: sensible definition of a batch effect relies on potential outcomes $Y_i(t)$

--
- what other estimands "might" people discuss?

---

### Conditional Effect

- Observe $\left(y_i, t_i, x_i\right)$ for all $i \in [n]$
 - $F_{Y\_i \vert t, x}$ is the .ye[observed] outcome distribution, conditional on the exposure (e.g., batch) and covariates $x$

.ye[Conditional effect] exists between exposures $k$ and $l$ if:
$$F\_{Y\_i \vert k, x} \neq F\_{Y\_i \vert l, x}$$
- most common estimands from observational data

---

### Detecting batch effects

- detection tends to be an easier problem than estimation
- Universally consistent CI tests exist for conditional and other non-causal effects in general settings

.ye[implication]: don't need to limit the scope of distributions under consideration, nor the types of "differences" that can exist between exposures

##### Lemma

Universally consistent CI tests produce tests for causal discrepancies if:
- exposure assignment is consistent (pretty reasonable)
- no unmeasured confounding (possibly violated)
- covariate overlap/positivity (usually violated in observational data)

---

### Overlap and batch effects (conditional)

<center>![:scale 60%](images/causal/ass_fail.png)</center>

- Overlap/positivity is a pre-hoc criterion: $P\_{T\_i | x}(t) > 0$ for all $x, t$
- "Approximate" overlap? Propensity trimming

---

### Propensity Trimming

- use generalized propensity score to "trim" individuals with extremely low (or high) propensities for particular exposures
  - generalizes well to $K \geq 2$ exposures [10]

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/vm.png)</center>

- Causal $\texttt{cDCorr}$: prepend VM to $\texttt{cDCorr}$

---

### Simulations

##### Settings

- $n = 100$ samples in $ \geq 2$ batches
- $d=10$ (low dimensional) or $d=101$ (high dimensional)
- Settings: non-linear, non-monotone, second order, and multi-class

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/Sigmoidal.png)</center>

---

### Simulations

##### Key Aspects

- Balance: how well do the covariates overlap?
- Effect size $\Delta$: how different is the data between batches?
  - $H_0 :$ no difference in batch distributions
  - $H_A :$ difference in batch distributions

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/Sigmoidal.png)</center>

---

### Question 1: validity

- Fix $\Delta = 0$ ($H_0$ is true)
- for all tests, varying balance from $0.2$ (low balance) to $1.0$ (complete balance):
  - estimate type I error rate over $r=100$ trials

--
- Valid test: Type I error rate $\leq \alpha = 0.05$
- total of 80 possible settings (10 levels of "covariate balance" $\times$ 8 simulation settings)
  - "Valid": lower limit of a 90% conf. int. for estimated type I error rate is $\leq .05$

---

| KernelCDTest | &#9989; | &#9989; | &#9989; | &#9989; | - | - | &#9989; | &#9989; |

- Causal cDCorr and KernelCDTest are only valid strategies
- Causal cDCorr only test which works on $>2$ exposure settings


---

### Question 2: power

- $H_A$ is true for $\Delta > 0$ (there is an effect)
- for all tests, vary $\Delta$ from $0$ to $1.0$ (outcome/covariate distributions very different across exposures):
  - estimate statistical power over $r=100$ trials

--
- Powerful test: statistical power increasing (to $\approx 1$) as $\Delta$ increases

---

### Power testing

<center>![:scale 95%](images/causal/powers.png)</center>

- Causal $\texttt{cDCorr}$ is only approach powerful in all contexts (and at or near highest in any one context)

### Causal effect removal

A function $g$ removes the causal discrepancy between exposures $k$ and $l$ if:

$$F\_{Y\_i(k)} \neq F\_{Y\_i(l)}$$

and:

$$F\_{g(Y\_i(k), k)} = F\_{g(Y\_i(l), l)}$$

--

- idea: $g$ is a (usually unknown) function which "corrects" the disparity between potential outcomes

--
- "batch effect correction": estimating $g$ via $\hat g$
- Conditional setting: estimate $\hat g$ using $\left(y_i, t_i, x_i\right)$ for all $i \in [n]$

---

### Limitations of $\texttt{ComBat}$

$\texttt{cComBat}$: model "batch" as a linear transform of an "underlying" signal

$$y\_i = \alpha\_{t\_i} \left(f(x\_i) + \beta\_{t\_i}\right)$$
where $f$ is known

--
- estimate $\alpha\_{t\_i}$ and $\beta\_{t\_i}$ via regression approaches
- How critical is "knowing" $f$?

---

### Simulation

Let $\mathbb E[Y\_i(t) | x] = \beta_x f(x) + \beta_0\mathbb I(t = 2)$ be the "expected signal" for a covariate level $x$ in batch $t$

<center>![:scale 60%](images/causal/sim_simple.png)</center>


---

### Simulation

Sample $(t\_i, x\_i, \epsilon\_i)$ and let $y\_i = \mathbb E[Y(t\_i) | x\_i] + \epsilon_i$ for $n=200$ points

<center>![:scale 60%](images/causal/sim_simple2.png)</center>


---

### Simulation

Fit linear model, obtain estimate of $\beta_0$

<center>![:scale 60%](images/causal/sim_simple4.png)</center>

---

### Simulation

Let $\hat g(y, t) = y - \hat \beta_0 \mathbb I(t = 2)$
- Success: $\hat g\left(\mathbb E[Y\_i(2) | x\_i], 2\right) \approx \hat g\left(\mathbb E[Y\_i(1) | x\_i], 1\right)$

<center>![:scale 60%](images/causal/sim_simple5.png)</center>

---

### When we "guess" right, balance doesn't matter

<center>![:scale 90%](images/causal/correct_spec.png)</center>

- "Extrapolation" works just fine

---

### When we "guess" wrong, disaster

<center>![:scale 90%](images/causal/incorrect_spec.png)</center>

- $\texttt{ComBat}$ will (willingly and ablely) give us arbitrarily wrong answers
- "Extrapolation" works very not fine: batch effects are worse!

---

### When we "guess" wrong, disaster

- "Extrapolation" requires extreme confidence in our model
- when the number of outcome dimensions are high, how can we possibly expect to "guess" appropriate $f$ (for every dimension)?

--

##### (Possible) solutions
- nonparametric estimation of $f$ ($\texttt{NeuroHarm}$)
  - number of samples can be low; unclear how robust techniques (e.g., GAMs) are to HDLSS (high dimensionality; low sample size) problem

--
- Propensity reweighting?

---

### Reweighting

- .ye[Goal]: approximately equate the empirical propensity distributions between the batches
  - matching [11]
- .ye[Implication]: improves robustness of estimates to model misspecification (Warnbaum 2012, VDV 1998)

<center>![:scale 90%](images/causal/matching.png)</center>

---

### When we "guess" wrong, stable

<center>![:scale 90%](images/causal/incorrect_spec_causal.png)</center>

- prepending "matching" yields stable estimates of batch effects
  - limited overlap: no information to do .ye[anything]

### CoRR Demographics


<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/demographic.png)</center>

---

### Upstream assumptions and batch effect detection 

<center>![:scale 70%](images/causal/ass_eff.png)</center>

- without propensity trimming, unclear what exactly conditional approaches are even estimating

---

### Procedure for real data analysis

.ye[Motivation]: does the manner in which we include/exclude samples for batch effect "correction" and subsequent inference matter?
- If confounding is irrelevant, smaller samples = similar inference, but (in general) higher $p$-values
  - If adjustment functions are reasonable "within covariate overlap", should get similar inference with approximate propensity trimming and fully matched

<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/eff_exp.png)</center>

---

### Edge-wise analysis

- Effect of sex on connectivity (per edge), conditional on age

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/effect_size.png)</center>

- (approximate) propensity trimming and fully matching yield widely different inference (much smaller $p$-values with fully matching)

---

### Different assumptions produce radically different inference

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/edges.png)</center>

- compare strategies using full data to strategies using matching: almost orthogonal inference
- upstream assumptions for batch effect correction play enormous role downstream
  - is batch effect correction adding artifacts?
  - are we missing crucial variables somewhere along the way?

### [Additional Content](#extra)

### Accomplishments (detection)

- developed new causal language and machinery for detection of causal effects in high-dimensional regimes
- demonstrated that adjusting the data to better reflect the underlying assumptions yielded valid and powerful performance
  - unlike existing approaches (which often were neither)

##### Implications and future work

- causal structure learning?
- causal discovery?
- large number of covariates?
- continuous exposures?
- $\texttt{VM}$ with ordinal exposures?

---

### Accomplishments (estimation)

- "It is impossible to publish a paper with multiple datasets in neuroimaging without using ComBat in 2023"
- .ye[internal validity]: "unbiased" estimand
  - batch effect correction achieves a "reasonable" answer, and lets us do "correct" inference downstream
- .ye[external validity]: statistical inference applies to a broader population
  - more samples $=$ "more general" inference
- internal validity is a pre-requisite for external validity
  - non-causal techniques can exploited by extremely minor model misspecifications
  - unless extremely rigid assumptions are met, what is ComBat even doing?

---

### Limitations and future work

- limited studies with high sample size and demographic overlap between batches
  - ABCD study [13]

##### Future work

- quantify batch effects as a function of different pre-processing techniques
- investigate essential covariates to measure for harmonization
- Developed principled connectome-specific methods for batch effect correction

###  Population Discriminability
- population discriminability $D$ is a .ye[property of the distribution] of measurements
<!-- - A sequence of items $x_i^k$ from individuals $i=1,..., N$ measured at time $k=1,..., s$ --> 
$D = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}))$
- Probability of within-individual measurements being more similar than between-individual measurements

---
### Discriminability: unbiased and consistent
- Sample Discr. $= $fraction of times $\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''})$
- $i, j = 1, ..., n$ and $i \neq j$ for $n$ individuals
- $k, k', k'' = 1, ..., s$ and $k \neq k'$ for $s$ sessions
  <!-- - Probability that distances from measurements of the same individual are smaller than distances from measurements of different individuals -->
- Sample Discr. is an .ye[unbiased estimator] of $D$
- Sample Discr. converges to $D$ (.ye[asymptotically consistent] in $n$)

---
### Connecting Discriminability to Downstream Inference
<!-- - Fundamental question: does discriminability .ye[matter] for inference? -->

<!-- ##### Assumptions -->
<!-- Data follows Gaussian mixture model plus additive Gaussian noise -->

#### Assumption: Multivariate Additive Noise Setting

- $y_i \sim Bern(\pi)\;i.i.d.$,
- $\theta_i \sim \mathcal N(\mu(y_i), \Sigma_t)\;ind.$,
- (the individual means have a center which depends on the class)
--

- $\epsilon_{i}^k \sim \mathcal N(c, \Sigma_e)\;i.i.d.$ and $ind.$ of $\theta_i$,
- $x_{i}^k = \theta_i + \epsilon_i^k$.
- (the measurements $x_i^k$ are normally dispersed about the individual means)

---
### Connecting Discriminability to Downstream Inference
Suppose $(x_i^k, y_i)$ follow the Multivar. Additive Noise Setting, where $i=1, ..., n$ and $k=1,...,s$.
#### Theorem 1
There exists an increasing function of $D$, $f(D)$, which provides a lower bound on the predictive accuracy of a subsequent classification task
- $f(D) \leq A$, where $A$ is the Bayes Accuracy of the classification task

##### Consequence
- $D \uparrow \Rightarrow f(D) \uparrow$

---

#### Corollary 2
A strategy with a higher $D$ provably provides a higher bound on predictive accuracy than a strategy with a lower $D$

##### Consequence

Suppose $D_1 < D_2$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(D_1) < f(D_2)$

##### Implication

We should use strategies with higher discriminability, as the worst-case for subsequent inference is better than a generic strategy with a lower discriminability

---

### Simulation Setup
<!-- - Construct $3$ simple simulations where the data are describable in Gaussian (or non-Gaussian) framework -->
<!-- - level of "noise" in the simulation is varied -->
  <!-- <center><img src="images/discr/sims_sim.png" style="height: 450px"/></center> -->

#### Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)

- can be thought of as looking at the "relative size" of the within-group vs total variance
- $y_i^k = \mu + \mu_i + \epsilon_i^k$ 
- let $\mu_i \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma_b^2)$, and $\epsilon_i^k \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma_e^2)$
- $ICC = \frac{\sigma_b^2}{\sigma_e^2 + \sigma_b^2}$
- $ICC \uparrow \Rightarrow $ between-group variance "contains" most of the total variance
- negative ICC? mean squared error-based estimator
---
#### Image Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (I2C2)
- simplest "multivariate extension" of ICC
- $y_i^k = \mu + \mu_i + \epsilon_i^k$
- let $\mu \sim \mathcal N(0, \Sigma_b)$ and $\epsilon_i^k \sim \mathcal N(0, \Sigma_e)$
- Wilk's $\Lambda = \frac{\det(\Sigma_b)}{\det(\Sigma_b) + \det(\Sigma_e)}$

- $I2C2 = \frac{tr(\Sigma_b)}{tr(\Sigma_b) + tr(\Sigma_e)}$

- "ratio of total variability accounted for between groups"
- Why I2C2 over Wilk's $\Lambda$? Ease-of-use for high-dimensional data
---
#### Fingerprinting Index (Finger.)
- "greedy discriminability"
- $Finger. = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^1, x_i^2) < \delta(x_i^1, x_j^2) \;\forall\; i \neq j)$
- $\forall\; i \neq j$: this property must occur for every measurement in the second session
---
#### Distance Components (Kernel)
- "non-parametric ANOVA"
- total dispersion is the sum of between and within-sample dispersions ($B$ and $W$)

- $DISCO = \frac{\frac{B}{n - 1}}{\frac{W}{n\cdot s - n}}$

- "pseudo F" statistic

### Limitations
- experimental design is not "one-size-fits-all"
  <!-- - future scientific questions will still need to consider the question of interest -->
  <!-- - e.g., an analysis of task fMRI may not want to use a pre-processing pipeline with global signal regression, but for resting-state fMRI, this may not be an issue -->
- Discriminability is not sufficient for practical utility
  - categorical covariates are meaningful but not discriminable
  - fingerprints are discriminable but not typically biological useful
- These statistics are not immune to sample characteristics
  - confounds such as age may inflate discriminability

### Extension: Discriminability Decomposition

#### Setting
$(x_{i}^k, y_i)$ $i=1, ..., n$, $k=1,...,s$, $y_i \in$ \{$1, ..., Y$\}
- associated with each individual, I have some other categorical covariate of interest, $y_i$, taking one of $Y$ possible values
- Can the population discriminability be decomposed as a sum of the within-group discriminabilities?

---

### Within-Group Discriminability

- Let $D(y) = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i, y_j = y)$ 
- $D(y)$ is the group discriminability for group $y$
- "How discriminable are samples from group $y$?"
--
- Note that $W = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i= y_j)$= $\frac{\mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) , y_i = y_j)}{\mathbb P(y_i = y_j)}$ by def conditional probability

--
- Let $w(y) = \mathbb P(y_i=y_j = y)$ denote the within-group weights 
- With $\omega = \sum_y w(y)$, then:

 $W = \frac{1}{\omega}\sum_y w(y) D(y)$ is the within-group Discriminability

---
### Between-Group Discriminability
- Let $D(y, y') = P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i = y, y_j = y')$
- $D(y, y')$ is the between-group discriminability for groups $y$ and $y'$
- "How discriminable are samples from group $y$ vs group $y'$, and vice versa?"

--
- Note that $B = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i\neq  y_j)$= $\frac{\mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) , y_i \neq y_j)}{\mathbb P(y_i \neq y_j)}$ by def conditional probability

--
- Let $b(y, y') = \mathbb P(y_i = y, y_j = y')$ denote the between group weights 
- With $\beta = \sum_{y\neq y'} b(y,y')$, then:

$B = \frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{y \neq y'}b(y,y')D(y,y')$ is the between-group Discr.

---
### Discriminability Decomposition

- $D = \omega W + \beta B$
- Population discriminability is a weighted sum of within and between-group Discriminabilities
- Can look at how the within, or between, group discriminabilities compare
- $\frac{W}{D}$ ratio of within-group Discriminability and pop. discriminability
- $\frac{B}{D}$ ratio of between-group Discriminability and pop. discriminabillity
- are certain groups more discriminable than others?
- are certain between-group discriminabilities greater than others?
- "ANOVA-esque" or DISCO-esque"

### The average treatment effect

$\gamma \triangleq ATE = \mathbb E[Y_i(2) - Y_i(1)]$

$H_0 : \gamma = 0$ against $H_A : \gamma \neq 0$

- .ye[Fundamental problem of causal inference]: we observe $Y_i$, not $Y_i(t)$

---

### "Standard causal assumptions"

- Consistency: $Y_i = \\sum_t Y_i(t) \\mathbb I\\{T_i = t\\}$
  - we only observe one potential outcome (the rest are "missing")
--

- Positivity: $P(T_i  = t | X_i = x) > 0$ for all $x$
  - covariate distributions "overlap"
--

- Ignorability: $\left(Y_i(1), ..., Y_i(K)\right) \perp T_i | X_i$
  - missing data does not depend on missing data
  - Did we "observe" all impactful variables?
--

- No interference: treatments of units do not impact potential outcomes of other units

---

### Causal assumptions allow us to describe potential outcomes

Under standard causal assumptions, $\mathbb E[Y_i(t)] = \mathbb E\left[\mathbb E[Y_i | T_i = t, X_i]\right]$
  - uses: .ye[$G$-computation formula]
  - convenience: $\mathbb E[Y_i | T_i = 1, X_i]$ can be estimated

--

$\gamma \triangleq ATE = \mathbb E[Y_i(2) - Y_i(1)]$

$\Rightarrow \gamma = \mathbb E[\mathbb E[Y_i | T_i = 1, X_i] - \mathbb E[Y_i | T_i = 1, X_i]]$

---

$H_0 : \gamma_x = 0$ against $H_A : \gamma_x \neq 0$

- Standard assumptions: $\mathbb E[Y_i(t) | X = x] = \mathbb E[Y_i | T_i = t, X = x]$ 
  - as before, can be estimated (and tested)

### Causal conditional discrepancy

- .ye[Causal conditional discrepancy]:

$F\_{Y\_i(k) | x} \neq F\_{Y\_i(l) | x}$

- for two "exposures" $k$ and $l$, there is a "discrepancy" in the potential outcome distributions for some covariate level $x$

--
- problem: cannot determine from data (some potential outcomes $Y_i(t)$ are typically missing)

---

### Conditional discrepancy

.ye[Conditional discrepancy]:

$F\_{Y\_i | k, x} \neq F\_{Y\_i | l, x}$

- can determine from observed data (statements about observed $Y_i$)

--

##### Lemma

Under standard causal assumptions, the following two tests are equivalent:

1. $H\_0 : F\_{Y\_i(k) | x} = F\_{Y\_i(l) | x}$ against $H\_A: F\_{Y\_i(k) | x} \neq F\_{Y\_i(l) | x}$
2. $H\_0 : F\_{Y\_i | k, x} = F\_{Y\_i | l, x}$ against $H\_A: F\_{Y\_i | k, x} \neq F\_{Y\_i | l, x}$

--
- Tests for causal conditional discrepancies are equivalent to conditional discrepancies

---

### Testing for causal discrepancies

Related: Conditional independence (CI) testing

$H\_0 : F\_{Y\_i, V\_i | x} = F\_{Y\_i | x}F\_{V\_i | x}$ against $H\_A : F\_{Y\_i, V\_i | x} \neq F\_{Y\_i | x}F\_{V\_i | x}$
- if $V\_i$ is nominal, this is a conditional discrepancy test

##### Remark (known)

If $V\_i$ is nominal, a CI test is equivalent to a conditional discrepancy test.

##### Corollary

Adding causal assumptions, a CI test is equivalent to a causal conditional discrepancy test.

---

##### Known
1. CI tests apply readily to high-dimensional data
2. CI tests apply to multiple exposures (lemma)
3. (Asymptotically) consistent test for causal conditional discrepancy testing (corollary)
  - works with .ye[enough] data

---

### Simulations

##### Settings

- $n = 100$ samples in $ \geq 2$ batches
- $d=10$ (low dimensional) or $d=101$ (high dimensional)
- Settings: non-linear, non-monotone, second order, and multi-class

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/Sigmoidal.png)</center>

---

### Simulations

##### Key Aspects

- Balance: how well do the covariates overlap?
- Effect size $\Delta$: how different is the data between batches?
  - $H_0 :$ no difference in batch distributions
  - $H_A :$ difference in batch distributions

<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/Sigmoidal.png)</center>

---

### Question 1: validity

- Fix $\Delta = 0$ ($H_0$ is true)
- for all tests, varying balance from $0.2$ (low balance) to $1.0$ (complete balance):
  - estimate type I error rate over $r=100$ trials

--
- Valid test: Type I error rate $\leq \alpha = 0.05$
- total of 80 possible settings (10 levels of "covariate balance" $\times$ 8 simulation settings)
  - cMANOVA cannot be used in high dimensional regimes (40 total settings)
  - KernelCDTest cannot be used in $>2$ exposure settings (20 total settings)
  - "Valid": type I error rate within 1 SE of $.05$

---

### Validity testing

<br/>


<center>![:scale 100%](images/causal/validity.png)</center>

- Causal cDCorr and KernelCDTest are only valid strategies
- Causal cDCorr only test which works on $>2$ exposure settings


---

### Question 2: power

- $H_A$ is true for $\Delta > 0$ (there is an effect)
- for all tests, vary $\Delta$ from $0$ to $1.0$ (outcome/covariate distributions very different across exposures):
  - estimate statistical power over $r=100$ trials

--
- Powerful test: statistical power increasing (to $\approx 1$) as $\Delta$ increases

---

### Power testing

<center>![:scale 95%](images/causal/powers.png)</center>

- Causal $\texttt{cDCorr}$ is only approach powerful in all contexts (and at or near highest in any one context)
