### Typical approach to inference

<p align="center">
  ![:scale 60%](images/defense/typical.png)
</p>
- goal: establish relationship between exposure of interest and measurements, conditional on other covariates
    - conclusion is externally valid: our analysis "generalizes"
- domain expertise: "downplay" role of unmeasured covariates, and reach stable conclusion

---

### Similar measurements can be collected using many different techniques

<p align="center">
  ![:scale 100%](images/defense/typical2.png)
</p>
- different acquisition protocols impart different "characteristics" to measurements

---

### Measurements are usually manipulated prior to analysis

![:scale 100%](images/defense/typical3.png)

- Data pre-processing and processing: procedure of obtaining useful derivatives for our question of interest
  - .ye[derivative]: information that is obtained from a raw measurement (a function of the raw measurement)

---

### Reality of inference

![:scale 100%](images/defense/reality.png)

- .ye[Accidental deviations]: sources of variability not of scientific interest
- .ye[Systematic deviations]: variability of interest
- fundamental question of data science: identify systematic deviations in the presence of accidental deviations

### What is Reproducibility?

- .ye[Reproducibility]: ability to replicate, or reproduce, a conclusion
- serves as a "first-pass" check for scientific utility
- currently in a "reproducibility crisis"

---

### How do we address the Reproducibility Crisis?

- fix post hoc analyses (e.g., $p$-values)?
- fix measurements (e.g., measurement reproducibility)?

Proposal: design experiments to maximize .ye[inter-item discriminability], rather than simply checking reproducibility after conducting the experiment

---

### What do we want of our data?

If we measure a sample multiple times, then each measurement of that sample is closer to all the other measurements of that sample, as compared to  any of the measurements of other samples.

Perfect discriminability

### What do we want of our data?

Imperfect discriminability

![:scale 100%](images/discr/imperfect_discr.png)

---
### What do we want of our statistic?

Discriminability is the probability of a measurement from the same item being closer than a measurement from a different item.

![:scale 100%](images/discr/imperfect_discr.png)

---
### Discriminability Statistic: Step 1

- Compute $N \times N$ pairwise distance matrix between all measurements
<!-- - measurements are indexed first by individual identifier, and second by "measurement session" -->

![:scale 55%](images/discr/imperfect_discr.png)
![:scale 42%](images/discr/dummy_sim_dmtx.png)

<!-- <img src="images/discr/dummy_sim_dmtx.png"/> -->
---
### Discriminability Statistic: Step 2

- For each measurement, identify which measurements are from the same individual (<font color="green">green boxes</font>)
- let $\color{green}g$ be the total number of <font color="green">green boxes = 20</font>

<img width="500px" src="images/discr/dummy_sim_dmtx_match.png"/>
---
### Discriminability Statistic: Step 3
- For each measurement, identify measurements from other individuals that are more similar than the measurement from the same individual (<font color="orange">orange boxes</font>)
- let $\color{orange}f$ be the total number of <font color="orange">orange boxes = 84</font>

<img src="images/discr/dummy_sim_dmtx_closer.png"/>
---
### Discriminability Statistic
- Discr = $1 - \frac{\color{orange}f}{N(N-1) - \color{green}g} = 1 - \frac{\color{orange}{84}}{20\cdot 19 - \color{green}{20}} \approx .77$

<img src="images/discr/dummy_sim_repr.png"/>

High discriminability: same-item measurements are more similar than across-item measurements
---

### Discriminability is Construct Valid

<!-- - under the given construct (what the simulation is supposed to show), discriminability provides a sensible statistic -->
  <!-- - other approaches do not -->

### What data will we be using?

- CoRR metadataset
- $N>1,700$ individuals imaged across $26$ different datasets
  - anatomical MRI and fMRI scans for each
  - Individuals are measured at least twice

---
### Analysis Procedure

Process each  measurement using $192$ different pipelines
  1. Brain alignment (ANTs/FSL)
  2. Frequency filtering (Y/N)
  3. Scrubbing (Y/N)
  4. Global Signal Regression (Y/N)
  5. Parcellation (4 options)
  6. Rescaling connectomes (Raw, Log, Pass-to-Rank)

$192 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 4 \times 3$ 

All options represent strategies experts consider useful

---
### Pipeline impacts discriminability
<center><img src="images/discr/fmri_cmp.png" style="height: 420px"/></center>

<!-- - Consequence: choosing how to pre-process your data matters -->

---
### Marginally most discriminabile options tend to be best global options
<center><img src="images/discr/individual_methods.png" style="height: 200px"/></center>
- Each point is the pairwise difference holding other options fixed (e.g., FNNGCP - ANNGCP)
- Best pipeline marginally (FNNGCP) is second best pipeline overall, and not much worse (2-sample test, p=.14) than the best pipeline FNNNCP
- We may not need to always try every pre-processing strategy every time

---
### Selection via Discriminability improves inference
For each pre-processing strategy, for each dataset, compute:
1. Within-dataset Discr.
2. Demographic effects (sex and age) within the dataset via Distance Correlation (DCorr)
3. Within a single dataset, regress demographic effect on Discr.

Question: does a higher discriminability tend to yield larger effects for known biological signals?

### Selection via Discriminability improves inference

### Typical problem in causal inference

<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal1.png)</center>

- goal: estimate impact of an exposure (smoking) on measurements (cancer), given a set of covariates (ages)

---


### Problem 1: Unmeasured variables


<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal2.png)</center>

- what if we didn't measure BMI, but BMI causes cancer and is related to smoking?

---

### Solution 1


<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal3.png)</center>

- Assume unmeasured variables are minimally impactful

---

### Problem 2


<center>![:scale 60%](images/defense/causal_dag.png)</center>

- Measured: old smokers, and young non-smokers
  - did the smoking cause the cancer, or is cancer just a function of aging?
  - Technical term: .ye[Confounding]

---

### Existing work

- classical causal inference focuses on this problem for univariate measurements (e.g., smoking)
- some work (causal structure learning, conditional independence testing) attempts to do this in multivariate regimes
  - how robust are these techniques to confounding?
  - what do we do for more than two groups?
  - what happens if the relationships are .ye[complicated]?

### Notation

- $y_i$: an outcome of interest
- $t_i$: an exposure of interest in one of $K$ groups
- $x_i$: covariates
- $y_i(t)$: potential outcome
  - what would the outcome look like if the exposure had been $t$?

---

### Causal assumptions

- Consistency: $y_i = \\sum_t y_i(t) \\mathbb I\\{t_i = t\\}$
  - we only observe one potential outcome (the rest are "missing")
--

- Positivity: $P(t_i  = t | x_i = x) > 0$ for all $x$
  - covariate distributions "overlap"
--

- Ignorability: $\left(y_i(1), ..., y_i(K)\right) \perp t_i | x_i$
  - missing data does not depend on missing data
--

- No interference: treatments of units do not impact potential outcomes of other units

---

### Motivating question

- .ye[causal conditional discrepancy]:
$F\_{y(k)|x} \neq F\_{y(t) | x}$
- When are causal discrepancies identifiable?

---

### Theoretical results

- Under standard causal assumptions, conditional independence tests can be used for testing whether potential outcome distributions differ (conditional on covariates)

###  Population Discriminability
- population discriminability $D$ is a .ye[property of the distribution] of measurements
<!-- - A sequence of items $x_i^k$ from individuals $i=1,..., N$ measured at time $k=1,..., s$ --> 
$D = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}))$
- Probability of within-individual measurements being more similar than between-individual measurements

---
### Discriminability: unbiased and consistent
- Sample Discr. $= $fraction of times $\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''})$
- $i, j = 1, ..., n$ and $i \neq j$ for $n$ individuals
- $k, k', k'' = 1, ..., s$ and $k \neq k'$ for $s$ sessions
  <!-- - Probability that distances from measurements of the same individual are smaller than distances from measurements of different individuals -->
- Sample Discr. is an .ye[unbiased estimator] of $D$
- Sample Discr. converges to $D$ (.ye[asymptotically consistent] in $n$)

---
### Connecting Discriminability to Downstream Inference
<!-- - Fundamental question: does discriminability .ye[matter] for inference? -->

<!-- ##### Assumptions -->
<!-- Data follows Gaussian mixture model plus additive Gaussian noise -->

#### Assumption: Multivariate Additive Noise Setting

- $y_i \sim Bern(\pi)\;i.i.d.$,
- $\theta_i \sim \mathcal N(\mu(y_i), \Sigma_t)\;ind.$,
- (the individual means have a center which depends on the class)
--

- $\epsilon_{i}^k \sim \mathcal N(c, \Sigma_e)\;i.i.d.$ and $ind.$ of $\theta_i$,
- $x_{i}^k = \theta_i + \epsilon_i^k$.
- (the measurements $x_i^k$ are normally dispersed about the individual means)

---
### Connecting Discriminability to Downstream Inference
Suppose $(x_i^k, y_i)$ follow the Multivar. Additive Noise Setting, where $i=1, ..., n$ and $k=1,...,s$.
#### Theorem 1
There exists an increasing function of $D$, $f(D)$, which provides a lower bound on the predictive accuracy of a subsequent classification task
- $f(D) \leq A$, where $A$ is the Bayes Accuracy of the classification task

##### Consequence
- $D \uparrow \Rightarrow f(D) \uparrow$

---

#### Corollary 2
A strategy with a higher $D$ provably provides a higher bound on predictive accuracy than a strategy with a lower $D$

##### Consequence

Suppose $D_1 < D_2$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(D_1) < f(D_2)$

##### Implication

We should use strategies with higher discriminability, as the worst-case for subsequent inference is better than a generic strategy with a lower discriminability

---

### Simulation Setup
<!-- - Construct $3$ simple simulations where the data are describable in Gaussian (or non-Gaussian) framework -->
<!-- - level of "noise" in the simulation is varied -->
  <!-- <center><img src="images/discr/sims_sim.png" style="height: 450px"/></center> -->

### Discriminability and  Accuracy

![:scale 70%](images/discr/sims_acc.png)

<!-- <center><img src="images/discr/sims_acc.png" style="height: 450px"/></center> -->

Discr. decreases proportionally with accuracy

#### Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)

- can be thought of as looking at the "relative size" of the within-group vs total variance
- $y_i^k = \mu + \mu_i + \epsilon_i^k$ 
- let $\mu_i \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma_b^2)$, and $\epsilon_i^k \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma_e^2)$
- $ICC = \frac{\sigma_b^2}{\sigma_e^2 + \sigma_b^2}$
- $ICC \uparrow \Rightarrow $ between-group variance "contains" most of the total variance
- negative ICC? mean squared error-based estimator
---
#### Image Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (I2C2)
- simplest "multivariate extension" of ICC
- $y_i^k = \mu + \mu_i + \epsilon_i^k$
- let $\mu \sim \mathcal N(0, \Sigma_b)$ and $\epsilon_i^k \sim \mathcal N(0, \Sigma_e)$
- Wilk's $\Lambda = \frac{\det(\Sigma_b)}{\det(\Sigma_b) + \det(\Sigma_e)}$

- $I2C2 = \frac{tr(\Sigma_b)}{tr(\Sigma_b) + tr(\Sigma_e)}$

- "ratio of total variability accounted for between groups"
- Why I2C2 over Wilk's $\Lambda$? Ease-of-use for high-dimensional data
---
#### Fingerprinting Index (Finger.)
- "greedy discriminability"
- $Finger. = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^1, x_i^2) < \delta(x_i^1, x_j^2) \;\forall\; i \neq j)$
- $\forall\; i \neq j$: this property must occur for every measurement in the second session
---
#### Distance Components (Kernel)
- "non-parametric ANOVA"
- total dispersion is the sum of between and within-sample dispersions ($B$ and $W$)

- $DISCO = \frac{\frac{B}{n - 1}}{\frac{W}{n\cdot s - n}}$

- "pseudo F" statistic

---

### Limitations
- experimental design is not "one-size-fits-all"
  <!-- - future scientific questions will still need to consider the question of interest -->
  <!-- - e.g., an analysis of task fMRI may not want to use a pre-processing pipeline with global signal regression, but for resting-state fMRI, this may not be an issue -->
- Discriminability is not sufficient for practical utility
  - categorical covariates are meaningful but not discriminable
  - fingerprints are discriminable but not typically biological useful
- These statistics are not immune to sample characteristics
  - confounds such as age may inflate discriminability

### Extension: Discriminability Decomposition

#### Setting
$(x_{i}^k, y_i)$ $i=1, ..., n$, $k=1,...,s$, $y_i \in$ \{$1, ..., Y$\}
- associated with each individual, I have some other categorical covariate of interest, $y_i$, taking one of $Y$ possible values
- Can the population discriminability be decomposed as a sum of the within-group discriminabilities?

---

### Within-Group Discriminability

- Let $D(y) = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i, y_j = y)$ 
- $D(y)$ is the group discriminability for group $y$
- "How discriminable are samples from group $y$?"
--

- Note that $W = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i= y_j)$= $\frac{\mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) , y_i = y_j)}{\mathbb P(y_i = y_j)}$ by def conditional probability

--

- Let $w(y) = \mathbb P(y_i=y_j = y)$ denote the within-group weights 
- With $\omega = \sum_y w(y)$, then:

 $W = \frac{1}{\omega}\sum_y w(y) D(y)$ is the within-group Discriminability

---
### Between-Group Discriminability
- Let $D(y, y') = P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i = y, y_j = y')$
- $D(y, y')$ is the between-group discriminability for groups $y$ and $y'$
- "How discriminable are samples from group $y$ vs group $y'$, and vice versa?"

--

- Note that $B = \mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) | y_i\neq  y_j)$= $\frac{\mathbb P(\delta(x_i^k, x_i^{k'}) < \delta(x_i^k, x_j^{k''}) , y_i \neq y_j)}{\mathbb P(y_i \neq y_j)}$ by def conditional probability

--

- Let $b(y, y') = \mathbb P(y_i = y, y_j = y')$ denote the between group weights 
- With $\beta = \sum_{y\neq y'} b(y,y')$, then:

$B = \frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{y \neq y'}b(y,y')D(y,y')$ is the between-group Discriminability

---
### Discriminability Decomposition

- $D = \omega W + \beta B$
- Population discriminability is a weighted sum of within and between-group Discriminabilities
- Can look at how the within, or between, group discriminabilities compare
- $\frac{W}{D}$ ratio of within-group Discriminability and pop. discriminability
- $\frac{B}{D}$ ratio of between-group Discriminability and pop. discriminabillity
- are certain groups more discriminable than others?
- are certain between-group discriminabilities greater than others?
- "ANOVA-esque" or DISCO-esque"
