### Outline

- Motivation and background
- [Defining batch effects](#define)
- [Results](#results)
- [Discussion](#disc)

---

### Connectome data

- connectome: brain graph, where the edges indicates the level of functional similarity or structural connectivity between areas of the brain
<p align="center">
  ![:scale 50%](images/defense/fmri_conn.png)
</p>
  - very high-dimensional
  - properties about graph $\Rightarrow$ insights about brain function
- expense $\Rightarrow$ collect data and pool (mega studies)

---

### The problem of batch effects

- .ye[batch effect]: the impact of the data collection procedure (measurement device, measurement protocol, season, etc.) on the data collected [4]
- .ye[demographic effect]: impact on the data of scientifically "interesting" characteristics of the object under study
- When datasets are demographically diverse (high confounding) and measurements are large (high number of features), difficult to <tagname style="color:red">mitigate batch effects</tagname> while <tagname style="color:green;">preserving demographic effects</tagname>

---

### Existing work (detection)

- classical causal inference focuses on this problem for univariate measurements (e.g., smoking)
- some work (conditional independence testing) attempts to do this in multivariate regimes
  - unclear the extent to which these provide reasonable answers in the face of confounding for high-dimensional data

---

### Existing work (correction)

- ComBat [4]
  - fit a linear model, where individual "batches" are a linear transformation of one another
  - optional: "adjust" with terms for covariates (e.g., age, sex)

--
- Surrogate Variable Analysis [5,6]
  - use latent variable models to capture sources of batch heterogeneity

---

### How do we propose to address batch effects?

- "It is impossible to publish a paper with multiple datasets in neuroimaging without using ComBat in 2023"
  - problem: are they actually doing what we think? Are they removing batch effects?

--
- Proposal: leverage techniques from .ye[causal inference] to yield strategies which allow us to be .ye[precise] when referring to batch effects

---

### Motivating questions

- how do we formulate batch effects as a problem in causal inference?
- Do we properly understand the limitations of techniques that are used across neuroimaging?

### Motivating questions

- how do we formulate batch effects as a problem in causal inference?
- Do we properly understand the limitations of techniques that are used across neuroimaging?
- .ye[how do we develop and disseminate strategies for causal analyses with populations of graphs?]

---

### Outline

- [Motivation and background](#back)
- Defining batch effects
- [Results](#results)
- [Discussion](#disc)

---

### Motivating example

- two groups of batches of measurements
  - for each person, we measure an outcome (e.g., a connectome)

--
- .ye[Are differences between the batches due to experimental variability, or actual differences between the measurements for each batch?]

--
- .ye[Are measurements different simply due to the batch?]

---

### Associational Effect

- simplest approach: directly compare the outcomes across the batches
- what if we sample different age groups in each batch?

--
  - consider: outcome is a function of age, but we do not account for age
  - false positives: we detect an effect, but it the "effect" is just due to age differences
  - false negatives: the batches truly differ, but the "age effect" cancels out this variability

--
- if there is any confounding, not causal
---

### Associational Effect

<p align="center">
  ![:scale 100%](images/causal/ass.png)
</p>

---

### Conditional (Non-Causal) Effect

- compare distributions of outcomes across batches, but conditioned on age
- what if the age groups sampled do not overlap? One batch is adolescents and adults, the other is adults and geriatrics

--
  - conditional approaches make .ye[implicit assumptions] about how to interpolate the first batch to geriatrics, and the second batch to adolescents
  - when these implicit assumptions do not reflect the data, results can be erroneous (false positives and false negatives)

--
- subject to .ye[measured confounding biases]

---

### Conditional (Non-Causal) Effect

- compare distributions of outcomes across batches, but conditioned on age
- what if the age groups sampled do not overlap? One batch is adolescents and adults, the other is adults and geriatrics
  - conditional approaches make implicit assumptions about how to interpolate the first batch to geriatrics, and the second batch to adolescents
  - when these implicit assumptions do not reflect the data, results can be erroneous (false positives and false negatives)
- subject to measured confounding biases
- existing procedures .ye[cDCorr] and .ye[cComBat] take this approach

---

### Conditional (Non-Causal) Effect

<p align="center">
  ![:scale 100%](images/causal/cond.png)
</p>

---

### Adjusted (Causal) Effect

- discard data across batches that are not "comparable"

--
  - limit comparison between the two batches only to adults, since we have data in both batches
  - avoids potential for false positives and false negatives when the .ye[data do not support such a conclusion]

--
- robust to .ye[measured confounding]
---

### Adjusted (Causal) Effect

- discard data across batches that are not "comparable"
  - limit comparison between the two batches only to adults, since we have data in both batches
  - avoids potential for false positives and false negatives when the data do not support such a conclusion
- robust to measured confounding
- our proposed procedures, .ye[Causal cDCorr] and .ye[Causal cComBat], take this approach

### Upstream assumptions and batch effect detection 

<center>![:scale 65%](images/causal/cond_vs_adj_detection.png)</center>

---

### With high overlap, non-causal and causal approaches are similar

<center>![:scale 65%](images/causal/overlap.png)</center>

- recall: scanner is an .ye[effect modifier]
  - different scanners = probably batch effects
- causal and non-causal approaches agree

---

### With high overlap, non-causal and causal approaches are similar

<center>![:scale 65%](images/causal/overlap.png)</center>

- take-home: batch effects are prominent and detectable when we should detect them (scanners differ)

---

### With low overlap, non-causal and causal approaches disagree

<center>![:scale 50%](images/causal/lowoverlap.png)</center>

- recall: scanner is an .ye[effect modifier]

---

### With low overlap, non-causal and causal approaches disagree

<center>![:scale 50%](images/causal/lowoverlap.png)</center>

- non-causal procedures tend to say no detectable effect
  - causal procedures indicate the sub-studies are demographically confounded
- non-causal procedures give false negatives with confounding

- Discussion

### Accomplishments

- "It is impossible to publish a paper with multiple datasets in neuroimaging without using ComBat in 2023"
- .ye[developed new causal language and machinery for detection of causal effects in graph data]
- illustrate that our proposed procedures, .ye[Causal cDCorr] and .ye[Causal cComBat], rectify pain points of conditional procedures for populations of graph data

##### Implications and future work

- can we refine our proposed procedures by using studies with higher sample size and demographic overlap (e.g., ABCD study \[13\]?)
- continue refining and disseminating our proposed procedures via GrasPy package
